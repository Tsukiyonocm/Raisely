                    <p class="answersText">I feel I would be a good fit for the role as a Customer Advocate as I bring over 10 years’ experience working in a customer service role dealing with diverse types of consumers in each of my roles. I am used to dealing with people who might not have the best grasp of technology and its various facets then figuring out what their concerns might be and finding a way to achieve fixing their issues.  It’s my experience that one of the most important jobs a customer service representative must do is being able to deduce what a problem is and how to fix it when the customer might not even quite understand how to explain that problem. </p>

                    <p class="answersText">Even back in college, I always enjoyed helping others whether it be as a student aid or just on my own time. I believe this company gives me the best chance at helping the most people while also helping a business with an idea I can believe in succeed. Creating training tutorials, onboarding new clients or staff, or just keeping up with my own training I believe is the best use of my own time. I strongly believe in education and thrive when I can help others achieve their own goals using knowledge I have accumulated or research to achieve an end goal.</p>

                    <p class="answersText">If I was to pick two things from the proceeding list in which I did not wish to do it would probably have to be Recruiting a New Team Member and Responding to 20 support emails. The reasons being, regarding recruiting a new team member, I have been involved in the past with hiring process in most of my jobs, though not yet been fully trained in it. I feel that while I could do it in the long run, I would need a bit more knowledge about the business and the processes involved, as well as a bit more training just doing the interview/hiring process while shadowing someone better in the position. </p>

                    <h2>Tell us about a company who does customer support well, and why you think they're good.</h2>
                    <hr class="style-two">
                       
                    <p class="answersText">The second one, responding to 20 emails I largely do not like this one as that means that myself and my team are not living up to expectations. While some questions are likely to always be around I would like to believe that many questions can be mitigated early on with involved training and pre-emptive questions to the client during the initial conversations.</p>
                    
                    <p class="answersText">When thinking about good customer service I have dealt with in the past, I usually must bring up the customer service line for Microsoft’s Xbox Live Service. Having worked in gaming retail as well as playing games myself I have dealt with them both on a professional level and a personal level. In each time they could help myself or my client, even on calls that sometimes took upwards of 3 hours to figure out the situation and rectify it. I had to personally stay on the line with an associate before when dealing with a customer situation at my store, the customer service representative was a consummate professional. They never once left me feeling as if I was being a burden to them or that they felt the situation should have lasted this long. Often they were able to help my customers, or if not, they were able to provide further steps for my customers in order to proceed in taking care of the situation (usually involved repair of a device at this point).</p>
